# Why can we treat Strings as sequences? 
# Strings are considered to be a text sequence because the order of the characters in a string is preserved so it 
# fits in the defintion of a sequence which is an ordered collection of objects. Furthermore, individual characters
# of the string an be referenced, so it can be indexed.
