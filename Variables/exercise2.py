# Classify function names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, illegal 

### Since function names follow the same convetion as non-constant variable names, the answers are the same 

# index - idiomatic 
# CatName - non-idiomatic because it uses PascalCase when it should use snake_case
# lazy_dog - idiomatic
# quick_Fox - non-idiomatic because not all letters are lowercase, i.e., 'F'
# 1stCharacter - illegal because it starts with a digit 
# operand2 - idiomatic 
# BIG_NUMBER - non-idiomatic because SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE is used for constants
# Ï€ - non-idiomatic because it is not ASCII character
